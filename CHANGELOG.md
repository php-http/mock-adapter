# Change Log

## 1.6.0 - 2023-05-21

### Fixed

- We actually did fallback to the legacy message factory discovery so 1.5.2 is broken.
  Changed to use PSR 17 factory discovery.
  If you allow the composer plugin of `php-http/discovery`, things will work out of the box.
  When disabled and you do not have a PSR-17 factory installed, you will need to explicitly require one, e.g. `nyholm/psr7`.

## 1.5.2 - 2023-05-17

**Broken, use 1.6.0 instead**

### Removed

- Removed dependency on `php-http/message-factory` as the mock client does not use it.
